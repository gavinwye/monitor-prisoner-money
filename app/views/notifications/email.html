      Dear [intelligence tool user]
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We've updated the prisoner money intelligence tool.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      At the moment, you can search for, identify and monitor transactions in one or many prisons. But weâ€™ve added features so you can look at more specific transactions, for example, when:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a sender credits several prisoner accounts</li>
      <li>a prisoner sends money out to many accounts</li>
      <li>unusual amounts of money are sent in or out</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      A notifications screen updates daily so you can check for anything of interest.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">But, from now on, we'll email you each Monday with an overview of the past week's transactions. We hope this is helpful.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can turn these email notifications off at any time from your <a href="/profile">profile screen</a>.</p>

    <form class="form" method="post">
      <input type="hidden" name="notificationsEmail" value="notificationsEmail">
      {% from "button/macro.njk" import govukButton %}

      {{ govukButton({
        html: 'View your notifications'
      }) }}
    </form>

    <p class="govuk-body">Any <a href="#">feedback</a> helps us improve the tool further.</p>


    <p class="govuk-body">
      Kind regards,<br>
      Prisoner money team
    </p>
