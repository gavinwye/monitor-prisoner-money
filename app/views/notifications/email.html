      New notification features added to intelligence tool...

      Dear [intelligence tool user],
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We hope you’ve found the prisoner money intelligence tool useful in helping to track and monitor suspicious activity.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you haven’t used it yet, why not try the [updated intelligence tool](link) now because we’ve added some interesting new notification features?
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      These new features allow you to tailor the information you’d like to see and then get notifications about it. This could help you track unusual behaviour and possibly build a case.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      On the updated tool, not only can you search for, identify and monitor suspicious transactions in one or many prisons, but now, among many other things, you can be notified if:
    </p>

    {# Remove 'govuk-list--bullet' class for standard list #}
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a sender credits several prisoner accounts</li>
      <li>unusual amounts of money are sent in or out (eg, high or irregular numbers)</li>
      <li>a prisoner sends money out to many accounts</li>
    </ul>

    {# Paragraph font size class suffixes: -l or -s #}
    <p class="govuk-body">
      A notifications’ screen within the intelligence tool updates daily so you can check for anything of interest.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Also, you can get these notifications by email in a daily, weekly or monthly batch.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Why not set up your notifications now?</p>

    <form class="form" method="post">
      {% from "button/macro.njk" import govukButton %}
      {{ govukButton({
      html: 'Set up notifications'
    }) }}
    </form>

    <p class="govuk-body">We hope you’ll try the updated intelligence tool and find these new features useful. And any [feedback](link to contact us) you have will help us to improve it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Kind regards,
      Prisoner money team
    </p>
